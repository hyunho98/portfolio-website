Sometimes a performer is excellent on any and every stage. Sometimes they end up being a one hit wonder. Hot Mic is an open forum for people to review and discuss not just performers but their performances as well. Hot Mic is built on three models on the backend with a reciprocal many-to-many relationship (reviews) as well as two models built on has-many-through relationships
