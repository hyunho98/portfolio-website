One of the most common issues that people encounter when they first start gardening is organization. This is important because most working individuals may not have the time to provide consistent care to plants that require constant upkeep. Many budding hobbyists without proper time management and documentation skills suffer because of this. Green Thumb is built to assist gardeners in staying organized so their gardens may flourish.

## Features

- Add new plants to a database
- Edit or Delete plants from the database
- Set and reset timers that could be used to keep track of watering cycles

## Extras

Green Thumb is a web app for gardeners who want to stay organized. Built with a React front end and a Render database, this app was built during my time at Flatiron School as a way to practice working with a deployed database.
