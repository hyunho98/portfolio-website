Welcome to the Coffee Bean Database! Keep track of your favorite (or least favorite) coffee beans in one place! As someone who enjoys brewing and drinking coffee, I want to aggregate my personal experience with different kinds of coffee to document and share. I couldn't find a simple interface to do that so I created my own!

## Features

- Add new coffee beans with select attributes (location, name, tasting notes)
- Rate coffee beans on your list from 1 to 5 stars
- Sort and view coffee beans by location

## Extras

I built this project during my time with Flatiron School to practice building a local REST API, manipulating the DOM, and gain experience coding in ES6 JavaScript. The front end consists of a single JavaScript file that includes DOM creation, manipulation, and fetch requests to a locally hosted API.
