					<p>
						Hello, I'm Alex! Based in New York, NY, I'm a dynamic and team-focused Software Engineer with a passion for Full Stack Development. 
						I specialize in Ruby (Rails), SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL), as well as JavaScript (React.js, Node.js), and HTML5/CSS.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						My projects showcase my skills and commitment to efficient, secure, and user-friendly solutions. 
						Notable projects include "ad-space," an open ad market connecting companies and agencies, and "hot-mic," a platform for users to share reviews on live events.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Beyond coding, I've cultivated strong communication and teamwork skills through various work experiences. 
						At Promise Christian Academy, I not only taught coding but also mentored students, preparing them for the NYC Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). 
						Additionally, my management role at Cafe L'AMI involved overseeing front-of-house operations, managing employees, and fostering a collaborative work environment.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Whether it be through code or my hobbies, I enjoy taking things apart and taking the time to truly understand how different components and machanisms work together.
						Outside of work, I like to indulge this kind of curiosity through personal hobbies that let me work with my hands.
						Some of the more recent hobbies include building PCs and keyboards, music theory, and arduino based home entertainment systems.
